DropOut is a modern, reproducible, and developer-grade Minecraft launcher.
It is designed not just to launch Minecraft, but to manage Minecraft environments as deterministic, versioned workspaces.

Built with Tauri v2 and Rust, DropOut delivers native performance and minimal resource usage, paired with a modern reactive web UI built with React 19, Shadcn UI, and Tailwind CSS 4.

> Minecraft environments are complex systems.
> DropOut treats them like software projects.

## Why DropOut?

Most Minecraft launchers focus on getting you into the game.
DropOut focuses on keeping your game stable, debuggable, and reproducible.

- Your instance worked yesterday but broke today?  
→ DropOut makes it traceable.

- Sharing a modpack means zipping gigabytes?  
→ DropOut shares exact dependency manifests.

- Java, loader, mods, configs drift out of sync?  
→ DropOut locks them together.

This launcher is built for players who value control, transparency, and long-term stability.
