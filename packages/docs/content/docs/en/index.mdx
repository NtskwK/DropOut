## Why DropOut?

Most Minecraft launchers focus on getting you into the game. DropOut focuses on keeping your game **stable**, **debuggable**, and **reproducible**.

- Your instance worked yesterday but broke today? → **DropOut makes it traceable.**
- Sharing a modpack means zipping gigabytes? → **DropOut shares exact dependency manifests.**
- Java, loader, mods, configs drift out of sync? → **DropOut locks them together.**

This launcher is built for players who value control, transparency, and long-term stability.
