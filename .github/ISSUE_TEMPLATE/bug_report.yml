        3. Copy the generated log link and paste it below

        - **macOS**: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/com.dropout.launcher/logs`
        - **Linux**: `$HOME/.local/share/com.dropout.launcher`

        If applicable, add screenshots or screen recordings to help explain your problem.
        
        **Screenshot Requirements:**
        - Use native screenshot tools (Windows: `Win+Shift+S`, macOS: `Cmd+Shift+4`, Linux: `gnome-screenshot`/`spectacle`)
        - DO NOT use QQ/WeChat/Discord screenshot tools as they may alter resolution and aspect ratio
        - Provide unobstructed original images, avoid window borders or overlays
        - For game-related issues, capture the actual game window
        - Keep the original resolution and DPI
        
        You can compress large files before uploading.
